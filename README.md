JSONfn packaged for Meteor. Stringify and parse wrapped to preserve functions.

__From the [website](http://www.eslinstructor.net/jsonfn/)__

_JSONfn is a javascript plugin to convert jsvascript object with functions into a string and convert this string back to the object._

_With this plugin you can easily serialize any javascript object, save this string in a local storage or on a server and then get the string and convert it back to object. I repeat it: object with functions!_

_If you still reading this text, you probably don't need any other arguments to start using this plugin. Well, one more thing: it's only 0.34K (yes, three hundred and forty bytes :)._
